# Liri
## Requirements

The challenge was to use Node JS to create a LIRI bot, like iPhone's SIRI, but takes in command through Language vs Speech. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and returns data based on one of four commands:

* my-tweets

* spotify-this-song

* movie-this

* do-what-it-says

##What the Commands do

####my-tweets

This command displays my last 20 tweets that I posted.

####spotify-this-song <song name>

This displays the artist, song's name, album, and a preview of the song the user types after the command.

####movie-this <movie name>

This displays the movie title, year, rating, country, language, plot, and actors of the movie the user types in after the command.

####do-what-it-says

This runs the song written on the random.text file through the spotify-this-song function.

##What I Used

*Node.js
*Twitter NPM Package
*Spotify NPM Package
*Request NPM Package
*OMDB API
